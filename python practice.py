# python  has three numeric types and they are assigned as they are created
x = 2 #this is an integer
y = 2.34 #this is a float
z = 2j #this is a complex number type

type(x) #verifys the type of the function

#operators in python are very similar to other languages
#some helpful operators are -= and +=


#lists in python are not immutable and are not sets, meaning they can have repeated elements

fruitList = ["apples", "kiwi", "orange"]
print (fruitList)

for x in fruitList:
    print(x)

#the output of this code will print each element

# the break statement will stop the loop at a given element

#funcitnons in pythoon are written like this
def shoot():
    print("Boom!")

#you can add array elements with append() and remove with pop()
